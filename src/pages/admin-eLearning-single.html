								<p>AIJA Workshop 'Toolkit for Change – Why do we need more diverse and inclusive law firms? Where’s the bargain?' took place on 13 April 2022.</p>

								<p>DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) in law firms is a much-discussed topic nowadays. Nonetheless, the more is said, the less is understood as to how it should be working in practice. The purpose of this webinar is to have a frank and open discussion about which are the real and tangible reasons for improving DEI in law firms. The speakers provided views from different angles in order to answer some of the most frequently asked (but still unanswered) questions in the field. In particular, speakers addressed which are the benefits that DEI in law firms brings both to personal and professional development and rise of lawyers, and to the development of the law firms’ business.</p>
									
								<p>Speakers also provided the audience with some practical tips, guidelines, first-hand experiences, that can guide attendees towards a more informed and conscious involvement in the process of improving DEI in their law firms.</p>
