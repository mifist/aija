							<h3>Second Tab</h3>
							<p>We don't have anything but happy trees here. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play
								back-and-forth. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Without washing
								the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green.
								This is a fantastic little painting. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See
								it finished in your mind before you ever start.</p>

							<h3>Third Tab</h3>
							<p>Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Happy painting, God
								bless. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. And right there you got an
								almighty cloud. A fan brush can be your best friend. Look at them little rascals.</p>

							<h3>Fourth Tab</h3>
							<p>Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy
								downs. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall
								happening over here. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. So often
								we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.</p>
