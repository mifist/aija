							<p>Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy
								downs. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall
								happening over here. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. So often
								we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.</p>
