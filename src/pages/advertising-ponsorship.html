						<p>Our twenty Commissions operate all around the world in cooperation with the various AIJA Commissions and external partners, such as the International Bar Association (IBA), American Bar Association (ABA), InterPacific Bar Association (IPBA), Union Internationale des Avocats (UIA). In many jurisdictions, the AIJA educational programmes are recognised on an individual basis and certified as Continuing Legal Education (CLE).</p>

						<p>The success of our Commissions relies on the friendliness, enthusiasm and commitment of their members as well as the quality of their academic programme. Whether you are looking for new business or expert advice in a specific legal matter, you will find it through the AIJA Commissions. AIJA Commissions meet three times every year at the International Young Lawyersâ€™ Congress in August and the AIJA conferences in May and November. For further information about the Commissions, visit their different webpages and contact their respective officers.</p>
