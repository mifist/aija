							<h2>What is TRIAL International?</h2>
							<p>TRIAL International is a non-governmental organisation that fights impunity for international crimes and supports victims’ quest for justice. International crimes include genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, enforced disappearances and torture. They work to give victims the opportunity to obtain justice and reparation.</p>
							<p>TRIAL International is one of those rare new-generation of NGOs that go further than reporting on human rights violations and undertaking advocacy work. We investigate cases, often going to conflict zones, draft and file, criminal, civil and human rights cases, bring direct legal support to victims, as well as training partners on the ground, judges, prosecutors and especially lawyers, in legal and investigative techniques.</p>
